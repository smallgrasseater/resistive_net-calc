# resistive_net-calc
THE PROBLEM DEFINITION

Analyse aseries parallel resistive dc circuit  to produce the total circuit resistance and the total circuit current.
1.	The user of the program should be requested for the source voltage and the values of the resistors.
2.	The user should also be asked for the number of series and parallel resistors in the circuit.
